# COMP2511 Assignment Design Process

## 1. Presumption:
- Assume each device will not move around on the Jupiter.

- Assume anticlockwise is positive direction for each satellite.

- Assume each file has no limit of contents since each satellite could partially transfer or receive the file's contents when its storage is full.

- Assume each device and satellite are not able to change their name, type and height after being created.

- 


## 2. Design Decisions:

### a) Devices:
- All three devices are the subclass of Device, so there will be no redundant or duplicated methods such as getters and setters if making a class each type of device.

- `GetInfo` method could be created in the superclass since there are no specific requirements in each type of device.

- Each type of device has its own communicable range so the method of `communicableEntitiesInRange` is created in each subclass to prevent deep recursion and over nesting.
